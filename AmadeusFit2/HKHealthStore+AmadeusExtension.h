//  Easy to find the topmost stack of the data with predicate set to nil and completion block will tell the quantity from the samples. let's say 1,2,4,5,3 were the set of data entered , we just want to have the latest data, so thinking it as a stack we can pop 3.




@import HealthKit;

@interface HKHealthStore (AmadeusExtension)

-(void)giveMeTheMostRecentQuantitySampleOfType:(HKQuantityType *)quantityType predicate:(NSPredicate *)predicate completion:(void(^)(HKQuantity *, NSError *))completion;

@end
